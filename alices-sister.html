            <h2>About Alice&#39;s Sister</h2>
            <p>Alice&#39;s sister is never named in the original novel however she has been given a name in other media (e.g., <em>Margaret</em> in Tim Burton's films, <em>Mathilda</em> in Disney's 1951 cartoon). At the start of the novel she is reading a book that has no pictures which bores Alice into daydreaming. At the end of the novel she wakes Alice from her dream and listens as Alice tells her about Wonderland before sending her home and imagines how Wonderland would be.</p>

            <h2>My opinion on Alice's Sister</h2>
            <p>Alice's sister seems at the start of the story to be kind of negligent as she doesn't even dotice when Alice runs off. However at the end it becomes clear that Alice didn't go anywhere and her sister allowed her to have 'a long sleep' on her lap (though she does let leaves just land on Alice's face). The last section of the novel is all about Alice's sister daydreaming herself about Alice and Wonderland, so maybe curiosity and imagination is a family trait.</p>
